    <h3> My name is Florence, but you may call me Flo! </h3>
    
    <p> Hello! Nay ho! I'm an American-born Chinese (an "ABC" as they call it), born and raised in the heart of New York City. I love my hometown. I'm a piano teacher and I love to teach especially children. I enjoy the simplicities of life, hanging out with my friends, family, enjoying nature and love spending time with God, my heavenly Father. When asked what my hobby was, I said that I love to take pictures! </p>
    
    <p> When I was young, I grew up watching my dad take pictures with his Minolta camera (which no longer exists) during our family outings for family photos. I had wanted to take hold of the camera myself to capture all the things I see that are around me. I was too young back then for my Dad to let me use his camera, afraid that I might break or drop it, but it didn't stop me from wanting to take pictures. Whenever he took pictures, I would ask him to show me what he took.  Little did he know, I fell in love with photography! </p> 
    
    <p> I got very excited when I first bought my very own camera, a Kodak one to capture "Kodak moments". I just wanted to capture everything that I saw and take lots of pictures with my friends and family. It was quite popular back then. As technology advanced over the years in the digital world, point and shoot cameras were the first of ones owned and later on camera on cellphones. I still use a point and shoot camera, but now a bit more on Instagram.  I just love how the digital world makes it easier and something less heavy to carry (for me that is). </p>
    
    <p> This website is a tribute and dedication for my beloved father who passed away earlier this year. I'll always love and miss my Dad. I am so thankful for him and for everything he has done for our family. He was definitely the leader of our household.  He made sure everything is well taken care of for us and I'm very grateful for him for taking care of me for all these years. We may no longer take pictures together, but the memories will be forever in my heart. My hope is to see him again one day in heaven, to be together forever. Now that would be a &#147;Kodak moment&#148;! </p>
    
    <p> I hope you will enjoy the moments I've captured in my life. </p>
    
    <p> God bless you! </p>
